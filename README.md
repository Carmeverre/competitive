# competitive
Cheatsheets and solutions for competitive programming contests and challenge problems in the format of such contests.
Some of the code may be ugly and not DRY because it was written hastily, but anything not marked otherwise is a working solution to a well-defined problem, tested by an online programming contest judge.

First I'll add solutions to ACM-ICPC problems, some of which I solved in a competitive-programming-focused course, others for personal practice in the subsequent competition. It's a team competition, but we tended to split the problems and work independently. I'll only add solutions I wrote myself to this repository. For the record, my team won the course/university-wide competition out of about 20 teams.
For these, icpc_####.cpp will contain the implementation with sketches and haphazard internal documentation made during coding, and sometimes there will be a txt file with the same filename with some external documentation and complexity analysis (which were required for the less time-pressured homework submissions).

Next, I'm adding solutions to Bloomberg codecon problems, starting with ones I wrote a while back in python 3. I included question transcripts in the comments, since seeing the problems and testing the solutions on the site requires login.

I'm also adding solutions to problems posted on LeetCode and Codewars as I solve them. These are the problem sources I'm focusing on now - the selection isn't as large as ICPC's, but it's easier to filter their problems by topic and difficulty.
