# competitive
Cheatsheets and solutions for competitive programming contests.
The code may be ugly and not-dry because it was written hastily, but anything not marked in-progress is a working solution to a well-defined problem, tested by an online programming contest judge.
First I'll add solutions to ACM-ICPC problems, some of which I solved in a competitive-programming-focused course. It's a team competition, but my team tended to split the problems and work independently. I'll only add solutions I wrote myself to this repository.
For these, icpc_####.cpp will contain the implementation with sketches and haphazard internal documentation made during coding, and sometimes there will be a txt file with the same filename with some external documentation and complexity analysis (which were required for the less time-pressured homework submissions).
